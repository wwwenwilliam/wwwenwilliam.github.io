          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm a third year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto (if you have no idea what that means <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/" target="_blank">read this</a> if you're curious). I'm majoring in Robotics Engineering and planning a minor in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. I actually originally came into university wanting to do some sort of enviromental engineering but my interest (and skill) was more in coding than chemistry. Maybe I'll figure out a way to combine them some day... Outside of school, I like to play Minecraft and watch YouTube, bike and swim sometimes for exercise, and occasionally do something <a href="./projects.html">productive</a>.</p>
