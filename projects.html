          <h3>Artemis: aUToronto's Self-Driving Car</h3>
          <p>aUToronto is UofT's student-led self driving car team, which participates in the SAE Autodrive Challenge hosted by SAE and GM. I've been on the team since 2022 and I'm currently the motion planning lead for the upcoming year. Being able to work on this car has genuinely been one of the coolest things I've been able to do so far and I've learnt so much from it. This next year will definitely put my leadership skills (and technical skills) to the test and I hope we make a motion planner worthy to be on the car.

          <h3>GSoC: Point Cloud Smoothing with CGAL</h3>
          <p>This summer (2023), I had the opportunity to participate in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. My host organization was the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) and I got to implement a new-ish smoothing algorithm to be put in their Point Set Processing Package. This project was super cool to work on and I learned lots about open source, computational geometry and <s>template errors</s> generic programming. I also have to give a shout out to my amazing mentors for the summer: Sven Oesau and Martin Skrodzki. You can check out the project page <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/8ltgdTWo" target="_blank">here</a> and learn more about CGAL <a href="https://www.cgal.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h3>Hack The North 2023: Motion2Music</h3>
          <p>Motion2Music was my team's submission to Hack The North 2023. It's a fun little program that will watch you do a dance, track your movements, and generate some song based off your dance. It does kind of respond to different types of dances but it can be a bit unreliable for sure. But, it was built for entertaining and it certainly produces some entertaining results. Anyway, personally the best part of this was being able to meet so many new people like my 3 other team members and many more. I'm not sure if I've ever interacted with so many strangers in a weekend before and I was able to hear so many new perspectives and stories. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/NitinMa2/hack-the-north-2023" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repo for this project.</p>

          <h3>Processing Based Projects</h3>
          <p>When I started out with coding in high school, I made a bunch of projects using the <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing Library</a> since that was what we primarily used in class at the time. It's a collection of things like small games, visualizers and simulation type programs and to this day make up almost all of my GitHub. Most of these are probably too old to be an accurate representation of my coding style but I think they're still cool to look at nonetheless. It's also fun seeing some of the questionable decisions that I made and to see what I'd do differently today. Maybe someday when I have time I'll revisit some of these projects and make better versions. You can see some demos of these projects posted on Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRGuSly42dWnvERZRGjVhag" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
