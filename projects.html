          <h3>Artemis: aUToronto's Self-Driving Car</h3>
          <p>aUToronto is UofT's student-led self driving car team, which participates in the SAE Autodrive Challenge hosted by SAE and GM. I've been on the team since 2022 and I'm currently the motion planning lead for the upcoming year. Being able to work on this car has genuinely been one of the coolest things I've been able to do so far and I've learnt so much from it. This next year will definitely put my leadership skills (and technical skills) to the test and I hope we make a motion planner worthy to be on the car.

          <h3>GSoC: Point Cloud Smoothing with CGAL</h3>
          <p>This summer (2023), I had the opportunity to participate in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. My host organization was the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) and I got to implement a new-ish smoothing algorithm to be put in their Point Set Processing Package. This project was super cool to work on and I learned lots about open source, computational geometry and <s>template errors</s> generic programming. I also have to give a shout out to my amazing mentors for the summer: Sven Oesau and Martin Skrodzki. You can check out the project page <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/8ltgdTWo" target="_blank">here</a> and learn more about CGAL <a href="https://www.cgal.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
